### Hi community ðŸ‘‹
I enjoy learning and solving problems. 
Challenges motivate me, and when faced with them I stay focused and look for the best strategies for the best solutions.
I work remotely as a back-end developer, however I've also worked on projects as a full-stack developer and database analyst.

## Career ðŸ”­ 
My career as a software developer started 5 years ago when I changed my career path from Speech Pathologist to Software Developer I brought with me my communication skills team, focus, and problem-solving and this make all the difference in my path.
I started doing a technician course where I learnt PHP and after I went to college, I learnt Java, but when I applied to my first internship, I had to study Ruby for a project. So I taught myself Ruby really fast because we had to deliver the project to the customer. So because of my performance, I was hired in 3 months and after I received several promotions and Ruby became my main language.

## Study ðŸŒ±
I love backend, so I'm always studying databases, rakes, queues, tenants, and docker. All the things that I know I will put in open repositories to share my knowledge with the community
